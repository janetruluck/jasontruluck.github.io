  <h3>About</h3>
  <p>
    Hey there! I am Jason Truluck and I like to do stuff!
    <br/><br/>
    This blog will chronicle my travels and thoughts on doing "stuff". This "stuff"
    includes development, projects, travel and pretty much any thought I find useful
    to share or keep.
    <br/><br/>

    As a developer I primarily work with Ruby and Rails, but also use several other
    languages and technologies including: Java, SASS, PostgreSQL, Javascript,
    bash, and many more.
    <br/><br/>

    I also enjoy working with the arduino and raspberry pi, home automation,
    mountain biking, climbing, and installing computers in cars :).
    <br/><br/>

    Unfortunately, most of the time I would rather be coding so this blog tends to get neglected.
    I plan to change that!
