  <h3>About</h3>
  <p>
    Hey there! I am Jason Truluck and I like to do stuff! <br/><br/> This blog
    is pretty much a brain dump for things I find interesting enough to write
    about. Mainly this will be programming, projects, travel and pretty much
    any thought I find useful to share or keep. <br/><br/>

    As a developer I primarily work with Ruby and Rails, but also use several
    other languages and technologies including: Elixir, Phoenix, Java, SASS,
    PostgreSQL, Javascript, React, bash, and many more. <br/><br/>

    I also enjoy working with the arduino and raspberry pi, home automation,
    mountain biking, climbing, and installing computers in cars. <br/><br/>

    Unfortunately, most of the time I would rather be coding so this blog tends
    to get neglected. I plan to change that!

    If you would like to get in contact with me feel free to give me a shout
    through any of the avenues in the footer below.
