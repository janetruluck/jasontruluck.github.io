This is a quick port of the [Atom Dark](https://github.com/atom/atom-dark-ui) UI theme from the Atom editor.
I am really enjoying this theme because of its minimalizim and use of cooler colors
(I am not a huge fan of the warmer colors). Since Atom is still in beta and lacking 
some functionality (for now) that I need for the day to day I figured I would take 
a stab at making a Sublime Text theme. Of course this is probably far from perfect
(gimmie a break its my first one!) but will solidify over time. Ya' know, iterations!
Without further ado, here is a quick peak at the theme, go ahead over to 
[Github](https://github.com/jasontruluck/Atom-Dark.tmTheme) and give it a try!
